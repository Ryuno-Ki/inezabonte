## Current Status

I'm currently seeking employment as a FullStack Developer. I'm open to remote positions. 
If you would like to work together feel free to send me an email at [inezabonte@gmail.com](mailto:inezabonte@gmail.com)

## What I'm currently working on

- I've been working on this portfolio for most part of my time. I'm really happy with what I've been able
to come up with. I have quite a list of [issues](https://github.com/inezabonte/inezabonte/issues) 
pending which I shall implement gradually as I continue to learn more about Next.js and TailwindCSS.
- I've also been learning TypeScript after realising how important it is in the developement process
and also the fact that it's an in-demand skill.
- In the coming weeks I'll be learning Gatsby for a project I'll be starting. Exciting üòä.

## Anything else?

Be kind to one another. ‚ù§Ô∏è
